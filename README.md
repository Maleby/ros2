Temperature Monitor is a python code that monitors the temperature readings: 

if the temperature is less that 70 degrees than it will send a log of what the temperature is 
If the temperature is higher than 70 degrees than it will send a warning message with what the temperature is

This code will need sensor implementation since the temperature is created from random to simulate the behavior of a sensor.
